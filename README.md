# Chest_X-Ray
Medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras. Used transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification.
Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.
